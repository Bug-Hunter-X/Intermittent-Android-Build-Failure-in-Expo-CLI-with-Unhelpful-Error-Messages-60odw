Several approaches can be attempted to resolve this issue:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Clean the Gradle cache:**  Invalidate the caches and restart Android Studio (if you're using it).
3. **Check Android build tools:** Ensure you have compatible Android build tools and SDK versions for your project.
4. **Review native dependencies:** Carefully review your `package.json` file and look for any potentially conflicting native modules. Consider using a dependency visualization tool to identify circular dependencies or dependency conflicts.
5. **Check for and update any Expo related dependencies**: Ensure expo and related packages are up to date and compatible with each other.
6. **Reinstall Expo CLI**: In extreme cases, reinstalling Expo CLI might help. (`npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli`)
7. **Create a new Expo project:** If other attempts fail, try creating a completely new Expo project and gradually add your code to isolate the problematic component. 
8. **Examine the full error log**: The error message might be a clue; even though the error might not make sense, it might provide some hints that can be investigated. 

Implementing these solutions, especially combining approaches 1 and 2, often resolves the build failures.  If the issue persists, providing the complete error log and project details is essential for further assistance.
