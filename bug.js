This bug occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with a cryptic error message, often related to missing dependencies or conflicting versions of native modules. The error message itself is not very helpful in pinpointing the root cause.  The project might build successfully on iOS but fail consistently on Android. The error is non-deterministic - sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, making it very difficult to debug.
